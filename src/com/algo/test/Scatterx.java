/**
 * A ScatterPlotApplet shows a scatter plot of data from a DataTableInput.
 * The user can enter the data in a two-column table that is shown in
 * the applet.  It is also possible to configure the applet with a menu
 * of file names.  These files, which must be in the same directory as
 * the Web page on which the applet appears, will appear in a menu.
 * A file can contain data for the table, with two numbers per line.
 * When the user loads the file, the data replaces the data in the table.
